    "# Probabilistic tf-idf\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic tf-idf is a probabilistic model for matching large lists of sparse binary vectors - primarily, I had tokenized company names in mind when creating it. It extends the commonly used tf-idf method of matching tokenized names in that\n",
    "\n",
    " * In the absence of training data (i.e. no known matches), it produces scores similar to tf-idf.\n",
    " * Knowledge derived from known matches can be incorporated to learn both better entity descriptions as well as token-level relevance parameters.\n",
    " * Even without training data, it offers unsupervised training that allows to adapt to the matching task at hand to some extent.\n",
    " \n",
    "The matching algorithm is computationally efficient by leveraging sparsity in the same way as tf-idf does.\n",

    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model consists of _entities_ that are probability distributions over binary vectors of a fixed size - the _observations_. I call the elements of the vectors _tokens_ because the main application I have in mind is matching tokenized short strings, e.g. names. The distributions are independent Bernoulli distributions for the tokens. Each observation is assigned to an entity, but the number of entities is not necessarily fixed. In other words, the model is a non-parametric mixture with a product of independent Bernoullis as observation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation the model is\n",

    "\n",
    "which can be complemented by an additional prior for $\\alpha_t, \\beta_t$, as discussed in the section on model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the entity resolution settings I have in mind, entities usually have very few observations assigned to them (often just one), so that a lot of the information resides in the priors. Sharing parameters across entities allows to share information on token usage across entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete the mixture specification, one needs a partition prior as well. This is discusse below, for now I focus on the observation model.\n",

    "## Collapsed Version and Sparse Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "An immediate problem with the formulation above is that the $r_{zt}$ are dense, so that even for tasks of moderate size memory issues arise. This can be fixed by marginalizing $r_{zt}$ using conjugacy. The resulting token distribution is still Bernoulli, but is expressed in terms of the sparse sufficient statistics\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to shuffle terms such that sums containing specific (token and observation/entity dependent) data are restricted as much as possible, while unrestricted sums only contain less specific data. This allows to both reuse computations as well as save memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the token probability with $k_{zt}$ set to zero (regardless of its actual value) by $p^0_{zt}$. Note that $p^0_{zt}$ depends on the entity through $n_z$ only. To simplify notation for sums, I use $t \\in \\mathbf{k}_z$ as shorthand for $k_{zt} > 0$ (and similar for other set operations).\n",

    "1. The first sum over $\\mathbf{x} \\cap \\mathbf{k}_z$ is a sparse matrix multiplication of two matrices with the same sparsity patterns as the document-term matrices for observations/entities have. Since we set probabilities for no token overlap to zero, the remaining terms have to be evaluated only if $\\mathbf{x}\\cap\\mathbf{k}_z$ is not empty, i.e. for the non-zero entries of the result of the sparse matrix multiplication.\n",
    "1. The second and last term can be pre-computed since they do not depend on the observation,\n",
    "1. the last two terms depend on $z$ only through the number of known name variants $n_z$ because this is the only dependency that $p^0_{zt}$ has on $z$. Usually there will be only a handful of different values of $n_z$, way fewer than values of $z$. \n",
    "1. $p^0_{zt}$ can be looked up from a dense matrix of size (number of tokens, number of distinct $n_z$). If there are very many observations per entity (say thousands) and a large vocabulary (say hundreds of thousands) caching may no longer be feasible in memory, but this should rarely be a problem in practice.\n",
